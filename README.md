## Features in Detail

### Timer

The timer is designed to track the time spent on the quiz. It provides real-time updates, and users can see the countdown in the UI.

- **Implementation:** React state and `setInterval` are used to create and update the timer in real-time.
- **Reset Mechanism:** When the quiz is retaken, the timer is reset.

### Progress Bar

The progress bar shows how many questions the user has answered and updates as they proceed. It helps guide users through the quiz.

- **Implementation:** The `ProgressBar` component calculates the percentage of answered questions and updates based on user input.
- **Design:** It features animated stripes and gradient fills, giving it a sleek, polished look.

### Animated Stripes in Progress Bar

The progress bar is visually enhanced with animated stripes, giving a dynamic effect that matches your theme's color palette.

- **Tailwind Animations:** Custom `stripes` animation in Tailwind CSS makes the progress bar appear smoother.

### Results Page

Once the quiz is completed, users are presented with their score, percentage, and a personalized message.

- **Score:** The total number of correct answers is displayed.
- **Percentage:** The score is also displayed as a percentage (e.g., 70% if the user answers 14 out of 20 questions correctly).
- **Feedback:** Based on the score, users receive feedback ranging from "Excellent!" to "Keep practicing!"

### Retake the Quiz

Users can retake the quiz, and their answers will be reset using a Toast notification for added UX polish.
